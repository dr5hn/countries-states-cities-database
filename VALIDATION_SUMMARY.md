Proper hierarchy maintained:
```
United Kingdom (country_id: 232)
├── Scotland (id: 2335, parent_id: null)
├── England (id: 2336, parent_id: null)
├── Northern Ireland (id: 2337, parent_id: null)
├── Wales (id: 2338, parent_id: null)
└── [217 subdivisions with parent_id pointing to constituent countries]
```

#### States/Subdivisions
- ✅ Total states: **221** (4 constituent countries + 217 subdivisions)
- ✅ Constituent countries: **4** (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland)
- ✅ Subdivisions: **217** (counties, council areas, unitary authorities, etc.)

#### City Assignments

## Testing Recommendations

### API Testing
For Poland, verify the following API responses no longer contain powiats:

```bash
# Should return only cities, no powiats
GET /v1/countries/PL/states/{voivodeship_id}/cities

# Verify count matches expectations
GET /v1/countries/PL/cities
# Expected: ~2,810 cities (not 3,124)
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Poland: Verify no powiats in cities
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cities 
WHERE country_code = 'PL' 
AND LOWER(name) LIKE '%powiat%';
-- Expected: 0

-- Bhutan: Verify 20 districts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM states 
WHERE country_id = 26;
-- Expected: 20

-- UK: Verify no cities assigned to constituent countries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cities 
WHERE state_id IN (2335, 2336, 2337, 2338);
-- Expected: 0
```

## Conclusion

All three countries now have correct administrative structure:
- ✅ Poland: Cities properly separated from administrative subdivisions (powiats)
- ✅ Bhutan: All 20 districts present, cities correctly assigned
- ✅ United Kingdom: Proper hierarchical structure with cities assigned to subdivisions

The data quality issue has been **fully resolved**.
