# Yemen Ad Dali' Governorate - Detailed Fix Documentation

## Issue Reference
This fix addresses the missing Ad Dali' (الضالع) governorate in Yemen's administrative divisions.

## Problem Description
According to ISO 3166-2:YE standard, Yemen should have:
- 21 governorates
- 1 municipality (Amanat Al Asimah - the capital)
- **Total: 22 administrative divisions**

The database previously only had 21 entries total (20 governorates + 1 municipality), missing the **Ad Dali' governorate (YE-DA)**.

## Solution Implemented

## Historical Context
Ad Dali' (الضالع) is a governorate in southern Yemen. The name is variously transliterated as:
- Ad Dali' (most common)

- Al Dhale
- Dhale

The governorate's capital city shares the same name. The governorate is located in the southern part of Yemen, bordered by several other governorates.

None required. The fix is complete. GitHub Actions will:
1. Import the JSON to MySQL (ID will be auto-assigned)
2. Generate all export formats (JSON, CSV, SQL, XML, YAML, MongoDB)
3. Update all distribution files

## Notes
- Entry inserted before Dhamar in the JSON array to maintain some logical ordering
- The `id` field is intentionally omitted as per contribution guidelines
- MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT will assign the ID during import
- All fields match the structure and format of existing Yemen governorates
