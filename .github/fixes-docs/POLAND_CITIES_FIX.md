# Poland Cities Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement

Poland's cities data (`contributions/cities/PL.json`) contained a mix of actual cities and administrative units called **Powiats** (counties), which are not cities but rather subdivisions of voivodeships. This violated the hierarchical structure:

**Correct hierarchy:**
```
Poland (country)
└── Voivodeships (16 states, e.g., Mazovia, Lesser Poland)
    └── Powiats (counties, administrative subdivisions)
        └── Cities (actual municipalities)
```

**Problem:** Powiats were incorrectly listed as cities in the API response.

## Issue Details

- **Total entries before fix:** 3,124
- **Powiats (incorrectly included):** 314
- **Actual cities:** 2,810

### Examples of Powiats (removed)
- Powiat aleksandrowski
- Powiat augustowski
- Powiat bartoszycki
- Powiat bełchatowski
- Powiat białostocki
- ... (314 total)

## Solution

Removed all 314 entries containing "powiat" (case insensitive) from the Poland cities file. These administrative units should not be listed as cities.

### Changes Made

1. **File Modified:** `contributions/cities/PL.json`
   - **Before:** 3,124 entries (2,810 cities + 314 powiats)
   - **After:** 2,810 entries (cities only)
   - **Removed:** 314 powiat entries

## Validation

### Major Cities Verified
All major Polish cities remain in the dataset:
- ✅ Warsaw (Warszawa) - state_id: 1637 (Mazovia)
- ✅ Kraków - state_id: 1635 (Lesser Poland)
- ✅ Wrocław - state_id: 1629 (Lower Silesia)
- ✅ Poznań - state_id: 1634 (Greater Poland)
- ✅ Gdańsk - state_id: 1624 (Pomerania)
- ✅ Łódź - state_id: 1636 (Łódź Voivodeship)

### Voivodeships Structure
Poland correctly has 16 voivodeships (states) with proper hierarchy:
1. Upper Silesia (id: 1622)
2. Silesia (id: 1623)
3. Pomerania (id: 1624)
4. Kuyavia-Pomerania (id: 1625)
5. Subcarpathia (id: 1626)
6. Warmia-Masuria (id: 1628)
7. Lower Silesia (id: 1629)
8. Holy Cross (id: 1630)
9. Lubusz (id: 1631)
10. Podlaskie (id: 1632)
11. West Pomerania (id: 1633)
12. Greater Poland (id: 1634)
13. Lesser Poland (id: 1635)
14. Łódź (id: 1636)
15. Mazovia (id: 1637)
16. Lublin (id: 1638)

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Administrative Structure**: Cities are now properly separated from administrative subdivisions
2. **API Consistency**: The `/v1/countries/PL/states/[state_id]/cities` endpoint now returns only cities
3. **Data Quality**: Improved data quality by removing mixed administrative levels
4. **User Experience**: Users can now reliably query cities within voivodeships

## Impact

- **API Response Size**: Reduced by ~10% (314 entries removed)
- **Data Accuracy**: Cities now properly reflect Polish administrative structure
- **Breaking Change**: Applications relying on powiat names being in cities will need to be updated

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the Poland portion of the issue reporting mixed administrative levels in Poland, Bhutan, and the United Kingdom.

**Status of related countries:**
- ✅ **Poland**: Fixed (this change)
- ✅ **Bhutan**: Already fixed (20 districts present, cities correctly assigned)
- ✅ **United Kingdom**: Already fixed (cities assigned to subdivisions, not constituent countries)

## Implementation Notes

The fix was implemented by filtering out all entries where the `name` field contains "powiat" (case insensitive). This approach is reliable because:
1. Powiats are consistently named with "Powiat" prefix or contain "powiat" in the name
2. No actual cities in Poland have "powiat" in their name
3. All 314 removed entries were verified to be administrative units, not cities
