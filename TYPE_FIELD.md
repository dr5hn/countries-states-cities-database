# The `cities.type` field

Every city record carries an optional `type` field describing what kind of
place it is. This page explains where the values come from, what each one
means, and how to filter the dataset down to genuine settlements.

> **Why this exists:** `type` is inherited from the upstream
> [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) feature classification. It mixes two
> different ideas — *what a place is* (`city`, `town`, `village`) and *what
> administrative role it fills* (`adm2`, `county`, `parish`). The same place
> can be tagged either way depending on whether it is also the seat of an
> administrative division. For example, **Dallas** is `adm2` because it is the
> seat of Dallas County, and major Australian cities are `adm1` because they
> are seats of state-level governments. Cleanup of this inconsistency is
> tracked in [#1303](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database/issues/1303).

## All values

There are **35 distinct values** across **156,025** city rows. Counts are a
snapshot (2026-05-24) and drift as the data evolves — treat them as
approximate.

## Filtering to genuine settlements

For use cases like *"find the nearest city, town, or village to a location"*,
exclude the admin-only and non-place types. An **exclusion list** is more
robust than an include list, because any new settlement-style value added in
future is kept by default.

**Exclude these types:**

```
county, regency, prefecture, parish, banner, province, area, oblast,
administrative zone, region, abandoned, historical, destroyed, religious,
historical_capital
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM cities
WHERE type NOT IN (
  'county', 'regency', 'prefecture', 'parish', 'banner', 'province',
  'area', 'oblast', 'administrative zone', 'region',
  'abandoned', 'historical', 'destroyed', 'religious', 'historical_capital'
)
AND latitude IS NOT NULL
AND longitude IS NOT NULL;
```

### JavaScript

```js
const EXCLUDED_TYPES = new Set([
  'county', 'regency', 'prefecture', 'parish', 'banner', 'province',
  'area', 'oblast', 'administrative zone', 'region',
  'abandoned', 'historical', 'destroyed', 'religious', 'historical_capital',
]);

const settlements = cities.filter(
  (c) => !EXCLUDED_TYPES.has(c.type) && c.latitude != null && c.longitude != null
);
```

This keeps all `city`/`adm*`/`town`/`village`/`section`/`locality`-style rows
(including admin seats like Dallas and Sydney) while dropping pure
administrative units and defunct places.

### Records with no type

About **1,900** rows have a `null` type. They are a mix of legitimate places
and unclassified entries. For strict settlement queries, the safest signal is
the presence of valid coordinates (`latitude`/`longitude` not null), and —
where available — a non-null `population`.
