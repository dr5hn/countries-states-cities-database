## Additional Findings (Informational)

During Round 3 validation, checked for various other issues:

### ‚úÖ Verified as Correct (Not Bugs)

1. **Cities ending with periods** (5 cities)
   - Examples: "Washington D.C.", "Bogot√° D.C.", "Sergio Osme√±a Sr."
   - Status: These are intentional abbreviations (D.C., Dist., Sr.)
   - Action: No fix needed

2. **Names with "excessive" special characters** (16 cities)
   - Examples: Cyrillic (–û–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—å—Å–∫–∏–π), Arabic (ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿàÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ), etc.
   - Status: These are legitimate non-Latin scripts
   - Action: No fix needed

3. **Lowercase-starting names** (14 cities)
   - Examples: "la Massana", "al-Khader", "az-Zawayda"
   - Status: Correct - these are articles in Catalan/Arabic
   - Action: No fix needed

4. **Word repetition** (1 city)
   - Example: "Irpa Irpa" (Bolivia)
   - Status: This is the actual place name
   - Action: No fix needed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Duplicate (Needs Manual Review)

**Austria - Velden**
- City 1: "Velden am W√∂rthersee" (ID 3675)
- City 2: "Velden am W√∂rther See" (ID 143865)
- Issue: Very similar names, same state, close coordinates
- Note: Different WikiData IDs (Q690077 vs Q660687)
